# Hey, I'm Rod Morrison 👋

**AI Solutions Architect | Full-Stack Developer | Houston, TX**

I build production systems that solve real business problems. Start with the problem, then pick the tech - not the other way around.

## 🎯 Background

Started as a developer, got good at technical sales, spent years at companies like IBM, Tealeaf, NetIQ, Tivoli, Contentsquare, and Highspot helping enterprises buy software. That taught me two critical things:

1. **How software companies actually make money** - the real revenue model, not the pitch deck
2. **How businesses misuse technology** - buying shiny objects instead of solving problems

When the sales gig ended, I got back to what I actually enjoy - building things. Taught myself modern full-stack development, earned 75+ Google Cloud certifications (Diamond League, top 1%), and started shipping production code again.

Turns out the sales background made me better at building. I understand the business problem AND I can write the code and build solutions to solve it.

Now I'm AI Solutions Architect at Raken AI Labs and run CodeRod Solutions.

## 🚀 What I Build

Most of my work is under NDA for enterprise clients. What I can share:

### **Switchi.ai** 
Multi-model AI chat platform. Switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI models mid-conversation without losing context. Live with paying customers.

**Problem solved**: Power users wasting hours switching between ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini tabs  
**Tech**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, Stripe, OpenRouter API, Cloudflare  
**Live**: [switchi.ai](https://www.switchi.ai)

### **Client Work**
Full-stack applications, cloud infrastructure on GCP, Azure and AWS, enterprise integrations, data pipelines. The stuff that needs to work in production. Most of it's in private repos.

## 💡 My Approach

**Understand the business problem first.** Then map the technology to solve it. Not the other way around.

Everyone wants "AI" right now. But most problems don't need AI - they need smart engineering. A well-designed database query can solve what people think requires machine learning. A clean API can replace what they think needs blockchain. The hard part isn't picking the latest buzzword, it's figuring out what actually needs to be built.

That's where a lot of organizations struggle. They get caught up in the hype cycle and miss the fundamentals. What's the actual problem? What's causing friction? What would move the needle?

Answer those questions first. Then pick your stack.

**Self-taught and pragmatic.** Learned by building, breaking things, and fixing them. The best way to learn a stack is to ship something real with it.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, Python, JavaScript  
**Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend**: Node.js, FastAPI
